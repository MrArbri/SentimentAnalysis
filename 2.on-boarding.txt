I still stay in touch with the HR and they were trying to, they said, take your time and everything is going to be well, don't worry about it. It's a new thing. So we all know how it feels like.
the documentations of the company are very well explained.
. They have taken quite some time to give a focus on the onboarding aspect of an employee.
you don't have to worry at all about it because we're all in your shoes. So they know how it feels like to be onboarded on a company and everyone faced the same, let's say the same errors that I faced.
And for everything that I would face difficulties, they would always be supportive and there to reply and give me some feedback. 
. And I feel like I'm safe hands. And yeah, that's what I can say.
we always take notes of something that is not correct or something that needs to be improved.
For the preboarding, I would say response time definitely plays a huge role in this.
I would really appreciate the fact if the company at least tried to reply to the emails faster within possibly a couple of days
from the company's perspective, I would say that they seem quite more professional if they respond quicker and faster. 
people try to be careful when they speak, so they don't offend anyone or don't make anyone feel, I don't know, mistreated or things like that.
"It's just the way that they introduced me to everyone with full confidence and that we have a new scrum master and she will be with you and help you. And that's what was important for me as well.

So they had trust in me and that was very good."
"Well, they asked me, how are you doing? How are things at home? Because I was also relocating and trying to fix everything and documentation.
So, they were like, how are you doing? Have you been anywhere? Do you need help with something?"
, they were trying to take feedback from my side as well, not just me going to them when I needed help.
So, they tried to make me understand how the teams work, how are they collaborating with each other, what systems do we have. I mean, not in details because it's not important for my work, but at least so I understand how they work.
, information is very important. So, as to be as clear as they can with documentation, with the steps that you need to take, where are you going, how are you doing this and all these things, information and transparency, of course. Well, they have to trust you as well and to show the trust that they have in you.
they always should keep their word. If they promise you something, they should make that expectation because otherwise, then you will be distrustful to them.
Only sometimes, for example, the communication through email, maybe it continues to be done as well in German, then it made me a bit left out in this case.
the supervisor presented me in front of like maybe 30 or 40 employees, employees in this case, developers. So I kind of felt honored to present myself in front of them,
And I had like good, good feedback about my progression towards getting to know better their products.
I was doing the trainings for both products simultaneously. So that was a bit overwhelmed, which I later on required, for example, to get the first training, finish that and start with the second training. 
that first month test phase can be really, really stressful in this case because if you just don't go through it, you are basically without a job.
Definitely open approach, open communication between both sides in this case, keeping it professional, however, in the meantime, like being friendly and open because a lot of emotions are mixed in this process for both sides
, there was no official training in terms of what was handed over to me through seminars or an educational overview of what the company does or what kind of products the company has.
everything was really fast and there was no time to adopt all this information, to process all this information.
, it would be nice to see a little bit of the background of the company, what all products they do offer, in which areas they're covering, what kind of departments that do exist. So, it was a little bit more general to this point of view.
Since there was a direct communication, we already had a good communication and a pre-boarding phase. So, yeah, everything ran quite smoothly.
There were actually quite everyone was there when I needed it. When I was meeting someone, I was popping on the corridors or to someone else I was meeting. They were open to me, they were saying if I need something
That was also from my team leader, it was quite good when the information was directly and really approachable. So that went quite well, I have to say.
the training should be a bit more organized or more structured, let's say, in a way that we should know what to expect and what will be taken over from me
I felt in some points that I was losing the full picture because I needed to do things on my own in order to understand this and I had to go back and ask again for the same thing. So either I didn't have the full picture or let's say it was not a good communication, the knowledge was not transferred correctly.
First of all, to be clear with them, what is expected from them, why it is expected from them. So when this is good communicating and clear communicated to get the feedback in terms of are you okay with this, are you happy with this.
So, it was a mix of feelings of fear and also excitement because I was going to learn new things. And I am currently learning a lot of new things and that's what I actually like.
Well, the company, as I said, has this very nice strategy and the goals for the trainings. So, they have different platforms for trainings and depending on the department they have, it's specific. And they were very clear about this in the beginning.
Well, actually, I talked to HR. They were very… They cared what I was going to say.
if you have something to say, they really listen and try to solve it for you if they can, of course, because there are some things you cannot do anything about it. But for what they have in their hands to do, they actually did it for me and listened.
"I was learning too fast. So, I really felt appreciated because it was like… It's only your third day and you're doing stuff.

So, that really got me… I felt appreciated and I felt good. It got me motivated to even go on with other tasks."
They were really good in explaining the organizational structure and everything. But in my department, I would have liked to get into more detail on what one is doing so that the other knows as well. It's like communication between the team.
I was being part of the team, like for real, getting things done and being involved. That's very important from the first days of my work. In general, it was good.
When you say certain things and you present certain things in the pre-boarding period, and the onboarding period matching those two, what you say and what you really do, it's very important for me to build trust on anyone, not just the company. If they say something different in my pre-onboarding and it turns out to be different, usually that would lose my trust.
, it was quite demanding from the side of my team leader, because it was like too much information at once,
everything came at once and it was quite demanding in a way that, in a sense that quite stressful, in my opinion.
The thing that probably affected the trust quite badly for me, it was the amount of workload, actually.
Then my trust was a bit shaky, actually, a little bit. Because all of these many things, I understand why I had to stay longer. Because as I say, that's actually the result of so much information at once.
to recalculate the workload that an employee has.
sometimes it's quite too much and someone can get very overwhelmed. So probably a better calculation for the workload, actually
