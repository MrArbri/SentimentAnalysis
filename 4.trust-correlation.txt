I'm 27 years old.
"Okay, so my name is Harry. I basically moved to Vienna four years ago. I'm 27 years old.

I moved here to Vienna to complete my master's degree. Since then, I've mostly been focused on my studies, but also working part-time for different companies.
And just now, two weeks ago, I started working for a tech company here in Vienna. So right now, I'm almost about to finish my studies, and then I will focus on working full-time for this company. "
Right now, I'm working as a front-end developer. So that's in IT. And I will also be working as an IT security for the same company.
Yes, my nationality is Albanian, but I was born in Greece. But yeah, it's Albanian.
because I was also studying business informatics for both my bachelor's and my master's, I always had an interest in developing web solutions, web app solutions.
I would also say that I'm a very fast learner and very curious. This is what drives me and makes me move forward in order to learn new things every day and to expand my knowledges and everything.
have been working now for two weeks
And I was also in close touch with the HR, the CTO and the CEO. So after I was accepted, I received an email from each department. So yeah, I would say the HR department and the CTO and CEO.
They were quite responsive, really fast, I would say. And there were instructions, obviously. I was sent a contract, an agreement, everything was signed.
So in this instance, I would say that it was really organized. So it was a positive experience to me. I also didn't have to wait for a long time for each email.
, the previous company that I was working for, and they weren't really so responsive. And to me, that means that they either weren't so interested in me, or maybe they were waiting for another candidate, even though they accepted me, or they weren't as professional as I thought them to be.
in the beginning, I wasn't really clear, but I didn't want to ask any questions to them regarding this, because I think that getting things done in the technical aspect is more important.
. I would just say that they really valued my skills and my expertise, and I could tell that they were really interested in me as a person, as an employee.
when I told the current company that I also had received an offer from another company, they really seemed to be pushing more. So I also had an in-person interview where I saw that, okay, the CEO was really trying to convince me and join the company.
I was also told that the company has a lot of benefits and then I was listed all of them.
I think that the company was really trying to push forward and also onboard me. So that made me feel more special. And at the very same day when I was having the interview with this company, I made my decision, okay, I'm going to have to join them because they were really pushing.
was 10 days 
I would say that I was very confident since the first day I wasn't anxious, unlike my first, uh, experiences with other companies.
I was able to be in touch with the team, most specifically with the CEO and the CTO. 
I was introduced to the team, even though the company is a little bit small, the office and most of the employees are remote.
setting everything up in terms of hardware, software, uh, my work environment and everything. 
 the first experience was really good and positive, I would say, and quite professional. 
when I was introduced with all of this new stuff, I was overwhelmed and I felt a bit anxious and stressed, but then I was thinking, okay, this is what happens in every company and every onboarding. So everything requires some time.
I felt a lot of stress. Uh, not because of, in terms of expertise, but as I said, it's because it was something new and your company and your environment. So that plays a role.
I still stay in touch with the HR and they were trying to, they said, take your time and everything is going to be well, don't worry about it. It's a new thing. So we all know how it feels like.
really friendly and everyone is very helpful
the documentations of the company are very well explained.
. They have taken quite some time to give a focus on the onboarding aspect of an employee.
you don't have to worry at all about it because we're all in your shoes. So they know how it feels like to be onboarded on a company and everyone faced the same, let's say the same errors that I faced.
And for everything that I would face difficulties, they would always be supportive and there to reply and give me some feedback. 
. And I feel like I'm safe hands. And yeah, that's what I can say.
we always take notes of something that is not correct or something that needs to be improved.
For the preboarding, I would say response time definitely plays a huge role in this.
I would really appreciate the fact if the company at least tried to reply to the emails faster within possibly a couple of days
from the company's perspective, I would say that they seem quite more professional if they respond quicker and faster. 
I am more on the extroverted side, very social, very friendly. I ask questions a lot.
"I've been told is that I'm very collaborative and very trustful and trustworthy for other people.

And I do well with time management and stress management."
I'm 32 years old.
I come from this way from Greece, I'd say and Albania as well.
I come from this way from Greece, I'd say and Albania as well. I have both nationalities. I have worked in Albania for eight years in Raiffeisenbank and then came to Vienna for, again, Raiffeisenbank,
as a scrum master 
Here for seven months now.
they contacted me directly with my offer. They sent me the contract. I had to sign it and send it back. No need for hard copies or things like that, just by email or scanning, things like that. They had a list of documents I had to provide and that took a couple of weeks to take care because depending on the laws and how the documentation can be provided by school or by the national institutions and things like that.
then they sent me some more information regarding housing because we also have a relocation package that helps a lot money-wise 
information about E-card and I think for metal centre as well
it was some kind of good information and a guide of what is expected of you when you come here.
was very responsive and with whatever questions that I had, she was very quick to respond.
I felt like secure in a way. So, I was safe to have like to be more, how can I say it, not safe, but just like secure and that I'll find everything and I'll like have everything in place in a way.
Of course, you are scared because it's a different country, it's a different language and you are not sure what you'll find here. 
because I got information since the first days regarding documentation and contracts and things like that. 
I would have liked to be a little bit earlier because it was like, where do I go, what do I do, who I contact and things like that.
it was this feeling of having all foreigners around me, not just Austrians, there are from all over the world. And I have never had this kind of experience before.
it was a bit scary and anxious and everything, of course. 
the communication I had with HR and later then with my manager was making me feel easier.
People here are more responsible and they don't take things personally. 
there's also more careful communication with each other.
So, it's not like being diplomatic, but it's in the way that we don't hurt each other's feelings when we have something to criticize or we have something that is going wrong.
In the HR, it was like a normal HR interviews. I mostly did the interviews with the managers. HR was very little involvement from HR, like very few questions from them.
"And I remember she said that the agile coaches are fighting over who is going to take you.
So, that made me think that I am valued."
during the questions and the interview part, they were laughing or having some reaction to what I was saying. So, that's a good feeling and you can read it on their faces sometimes when it's good.
, you have a feeling of being welcomed. So, I get to meet also the other scrum master that I will be working with at least more closely and have a feeling of the team.
They were very transparent with me 
So, they had clear information, they had clear procedures, they had people to take care of you, so it was what you would expect from an international company. Nothing out of the ordinary, but also not bad.
Of course, I was scared. I was like, how is my colleague going to look like, going to feel like? How are they going to like receive me?
the colleague that received me, he was very polite and welcoming and tried to show me everything and everything was prepared for me.
they were prepared for me. I didn't feel like, OK, no one is here for me or no one is welcoming me. That was very nice of them.
I always felt welcomed in the beginning. They were all very polite, ready to introduce me to other people and to show me around.
people try to be careful when they speak, so they don't offend anyone or don't make anyone feel, I don't know, mistreated or things like that.
"It's just the way that they introduced me to everyone with full confidence and that we have a new scrum master and she will be with you and help you. And that's what was important for me as well.

So they had trust in me and that was very good."
Well, the only information that I had from the pre-boarding was that I would have a buddy, like a person that would take care of my onboarding. So I didn't know what to expect in a way.
"Well, they asked me, how are you doing? How are things at home? Because I was also relocating and trying to fix everything and documentation.
So, they were like, how are you doing? Have you been anywhere? Do you need help with something?"
, they were trying to take feedback from my side as well, not just me going to them when I needed help.
So, they tried to make me understand how the teams work, how are they collaborating with each other, what systems do we have. I mean, not in details because it's not important for my work, but at least so I understand how they work.
So, it has to do more in training and things like that because in procedure-wise, it was fine. I mean, it's not that confusing or maybe where to find some materials, include some more links somewhere.
, information is very important. So, as to be as clear as they can with documentation, with the steps that you need to take, where are you going, how are you doing this and all these things, information and transparency, of course. Well, they have to trust you as well and to show the trust that they have in you.
they always should keep their word. If they promise you something, they should make that expectation because otherwise, then you will be distrustful to them.
I originally am from North Macedonia.
So, currently I'm working here as a senior web developer and as a consultant. 
, in about three months 
So, yeah, my fields were basically in the consulting industry working on and with several pharmaceutical industries as well.
I want to be punctual in my workplace and respectful to the others, open and friendly most importantly to me. 
it took approximately one month since the application and getting like the green light from the migration agency in this case. 
, in the meantime, I was, I would say, daily in contact with my current director in this case
And I always was getting updates regarding my status in this case for the visa, for the onboarding in this case, which is like creating the needed accounts and if I needed some support. 
What I didn't get that others, as I heard, are getting is the relocation package,
"What I didn't get that others, as I heard, are getting is the relocation package, in this case, help for finding an apartment, housing or anything like that during the onboarding time, pre-boarding time actually.

So, that was a bit distressful. "
they were very professional, but in the meantime, very friendly, because everything was, like I didn't have to do any bureaucracy or anything like that. 
But mainly emails and also phone calls. We were doing a lot of phone calls, directly cell phone calls.
that friendly but professional behavior gave me a bit more like a warm feeling towards my upcoming new adventure in this case.
There were mixed emotions in this case. Maybe the frightening, like being afraid of moving into totally new place or country was sometimes overwhelming my warm feelings towards the new place, towards the new employer. It was like fluctuating.
with all this communication and their friendliness, they provided me with good emotions in this case, and I was sure that I did the right decision.
Just getting in constant touch, constantly in communicating with me, caring about the needs in this case, and if I have any further requirements
, just the relocation thing, if it's included, would be really good. 
getting you into the office before onboarding.
I would say it was increasing trust based on their alertness and professionalism. So I would say it was increasing.
. Initially, I anticipated a bit colder culture here from the other colleagues and the teams. 
, I was surprisingly, in a positive manner, surprised actually because they really welcomed me in a good way in this case.
everything from the equipment requirements that I have stated during my pre-boarding phase was waiting for me at the table 
. Just an ease onboarding started with some onboarding trainings.
They were accepting me, they did accept me pretty well, actually, they welcomed me and they were inviting me for lunch and all that stuff. So it felt really good.
Only sometimes, for example, the communication through email, maybe it continues to be done as well in German, then it made me a bit left out in this case.
the supervisor presented me in front of like maybe 30 or 40 employees, employees in this case, developers. So I kind of felt honored to present myself in front of them,
So that felt really good as well
And I had like good, good feedback about my progression towards getting to know better their products.
I was doing the trainings for both products simultaneously. So that was a bit overwhelmed, which I later on required, for example, to get the first training, finish that and start with the second training. 
that first month test phase can be really, really stressful in this case because if you just don't go through it, you are basically without a job.
I feel like fortunate in this case because it was not that stressful or hard process 
And yeah, maybe because the lawyers in the corporate just took the job of migration into their hands, I felt safe in this case maybe. 
getting to know the team before joining in, maybe through some calls, video calls, and also why not this training of the products 
Definitely open approach, open communication between both sides in this case, keeping it professional, however, in the meantime, like being friendly and open because a lot of emotions are mixed in this process for both sides
Definitely open approach, open communication between both sides in this case, keeping it professional, however, in the meantime, like being friendly and open because a lot of emotions are mixed in this process for both sides
, I'm actually 40 years 
I have studied in Manchester in the UK, a bachelor's study in business studies and a master's degree in finance. I have experience in Austria for five years and also abroad for four years.
, I'm actually three months in this company 
I'm coming from Greece
I'm eager to learn new things
I didn't face any problems in terms of submitting all the necessary documents that was requested. But also, it was a lot of guidance at the beginning.
, I was contacted from my team leader regarding the last details. So, there was a lot of information on that point.
I received an email with all the information after I got the offer.
. I liked the fact that everything was written on a written form. So, everything was official and there were no mistakes and no misunderstanding from any side.
Well, actually, it gave me the feeling that it was a stable company. It was well organized. So, the HR department felt that they were doing the job quite well.
I felt quite good. It was a really friendly approach from the HR. And yeah, so far my experience was really good.
from other sides that were trying to clarify this and just say, okay, yeah, we need this and this. Are you okay? Have you completely understood what is your role?
"it was the feeling that the company was really international. Also, the people that were interviewing me were from different cultural backgrounds. But also, I could see also that the company and the other employees are not from Austria, so there's a lot of intercultural environment.

Something that was really, really good to see and that was making me feel easier to the whole process and more comfortable."
I would say that it was the clear objectives that were set
"each person that communicated with me actually was there for a particular reason and he was there to communicate his or her point of view. So, what was necessary for him to get as information.
So, I believe that actually helped me to understand that they know for what they are employing"
Everything was a good communication. Everything was in a friendly environment. 
There were quite a lot of people, a lot of trainees that were at the same moment when I joined. So, it was a strange environment, a strange feeling at the beginning because everyone was new and no one knew what and where he or she should go.
I was collected from two colleagues of mine from my department. So, they took me there to get my new ID and also to just start to show me the things around the building and where I should go, what should I do.
, there was no official training in terms of what was handed over to me through seminars or an educational overview of what the company does or what kind of products the company has.
everything was really fast and there was no time to adopt all this information, to process all this information.
, it would be nice to see a little bit of the background of the company, what all products they do offer, in which areas they're covering, what kind of departments that do exist. So, it was a little bit more general to this point of view.
The communication was on a friendly tone. 
I would say it was a bit more difficult because when you are on the first day, you are learning, you are starting from scratch. 
Since there was a direct communication, we already had a good communication and a pre-boarding phase. So, yeah, everything ran quite smoothly.
There has been quite good instructions to the other team members on how they could assist us and also there was a direct communication on what we should do, what to expect, where we should do it. There has also been a common lunch on that day, as far as I remember, to get to know each other better. I would say it was quite good.
There were actually quite everyone was there when I needed it. When I was meeting someone, I was popping on the corridors or to someone else I was meeting. They were open to me, they were saying if I need something
That was also from my team leader, it was quite good when the information was directly and really approachable. So that went quite well, I have to say.
the training should be a bit more organized or more structured, let's say, in a way that we should know what to expect and what will be taken over from me
I felt in some points that I was losing the full picture because I needed to do things on my own in order to understand this and I had to go back and ask again for the same thing. So either I didn't have the full picture or let's say it was not a good communication, the knowledge was not transferred correctly.
First of all, to be clear with them, what is expected from them, why it is expected from them. So when this is good communicating and clear communicated to get the feedback in terms of are you okay with this, are you happy with this.
First of all, to be clear with them, what is expected from them, why it is expected from them. So when this is good communicating and clear communicated to get the feedback in terms of are you okay with this, are you happy with this.
just to keep the promises or if the company cannot keep the promises, just to explain why or to try to adapt, let's say, but also give the space to the employees to develop and also work with them to get to the same expectations.
, just to keep the promises or if the company cannot keep the promises, just to explain why or to try to adapt, let's say, but also give the space to the employees to develop and also work with them to get to the same expectations.
Yes, sure. I have been working in the finance industry for over four years. Lately, I've changed into the IT department.
I used to work in finance most of the time
it's been like three months that I've switched positions 
I think I'm a very hardworking person. I have strong will and if I set my objectives and my goals for my career, I always try to achieve it.
they have called me, they emailed me and everything was also in verbal and also in writing. So, they were very effective from this part.
And I really felt like it was a very serious company. And for me, I felt good and very, let's say, I felt like I could trust the people and the people that were talking to me and calling me. In this case, it was HR department, different colleagues now.
And they were very helpful. In the pre-onboarding, they would call me because I had a need to apply for a new red-white-red card, a new visa. And so, they were very willing to help me with that.
it was very helpful and always being there if I had any questions or anything. Also, of course, they helped me with some presentations and they sent me some more materials and information regarding the company
I only spoke with them via phone and emails. 
sending also the PowerPoint presentations and other materials that I needed. So, it was very helpful.
Of course, they first notified me via a phone call and then they would send me the materials. So, it was very effective.
"There were some related to the company from the way that how they do business. And of course, also the ecological part that they are very complying with the environmental needs and everything.

So, that part sparked my attention. And it was something that I really appreciated the companies. And I look at when they care about the environment."
And always, if you need anything, just call us. And we will help you with any document that you need. So, that really was like, let's say, a good start for me.
. Because it's very stressful when you're international in a new country.
, that part is very stressful when you have to apply for a new visa and residence permit. That part is really nice by their side.
They showed me several materials that I would need for my job. And how the culture was in the environment, the culture in the team was.
Well, the other company was not so, I would say, not so precise. And they were not very organized. That made me feel a little bit like stressed and not showing trust to the company.
"And not being organized, being late with the replies, with the phone calls. That made me feel a little bit like I was very, let's say, not so.

I have my doubts for the company, for the previous one. Which I didn't have for the company I'm currently working. Because, as I said, they did every step right."
Of course, when you start a new job, of course, you're feeling a little bit anxious
I was feeling anxious
But then when I saw the environment and the team and everything, I don't know, but my stress level decreased. I was more relaxed.
But before, I was very stressed, to be honest.
They had organized everything. They put the things that I needed, like my laptop, the other parts, the screens and everything, the keyboard. They had prepared everything, my table.
They would give me a short introduction, again, about the company and hierarchy, organigram and stuff like that, more detailed. And then I would meet with IT. They would give me all my passwords, everything that I needed for my work.
Meeting the team was really nice because, as I said, I was introduced in my interviews, but I did not know them personally, so I was kind of networking between the departments a little bit. And that day, it went like that. Half of the day was trying to get to know everyone and trying to network with the colleagues.
And after that, I was in a very short introduction of my tasks and how everything was structured in the department I'm currently working in. And so, this is how the first day went by.
They were very friendly and very flexible. I would say I also liked that because they were... Of course, also in my previous job, the colleagues were very friendly, but they were more flexible in how they interact and how they do the job and everything.
I found them very friendly. And I, of course. They were very helpful also.
They were giving me tips, which I usually did not have this in my previous experience. So, it was really nice.
So, it was a mix of feelings of fear and also excitement because I was going to learn new things. And I am currently learning a lot of new things and that's what I actually like.
Well, the company, as I said, has this very nice strategy and the goals for the trainings. So, they have different platforms for trainings and depending on the department they have, it's specific. And they were very clear about this in the beginning.
but in the beginning that was not so much learning by doing more than just showing to me. So, I was hoping that it was going to be like I asked in the onboarding, in the pre-boarding, to get more into details and try to learn by doing rather than theoretically going through stuff. That was the only thing.
Well, actually, I talked to HR. They were very… They cared what I was going to say.
I'm thinking now that in my previous job, usually some people did not care how I felt.
". I also had a particular moment that someone was fired in the company when it was my third day of work. And I was really scared.

Why was that happening? And they were really, really supportive because I was somehow stressed why that happened. I was not understanding."
if you have something to say, they really listen and try to solve it for you if they can, of course, because there are some things you cannot do anything about it. But for what they have in their hands to do, they actually did it for me and listened.
They've been very helpful and surprised. They're really nice
"I was learning too fast. So, I really felt appreciated because it was like… It's only your third day and you're doing stuff.

So, that really got me… I felt appreciated and I felt good. It got me motivated to even go on with other tasks."
They were really good in explaining the organizational structure and everything. But in my department, I would have liked to get into more detail on what one is doing so that the other knows as well. It's like communication between the team.
I was being part of the team, like for real, getting things done and being involved. That's very important from the first days of my work. In general, it was good.
When you say certain things and you present certain things in the pre-boarding period, and the onboarding period matching those two, what you say and what you really do, it's very important for me to build trust on anyone, not just the company. If they say something different in my pre-onboarding and it turns out to be different, usually that would lose my trust.
try to communicate clearly your feelings, your emotions, whatever you have that you want to say to the company before starting the job or whatever questions that you have or that you want to ask in advance. It is very important to communicate before starting the job. 
I'm 33 years old 
I studied in Vienna. I studied International Business Administration, bilingual program. I've done some accounting and some business administration classes during my study.
. I'm originally from Indonesia
"I would say I'm a quick learner, I guess. That is the expression that I have. I'm also an on-time person, punctual.
And... I'm also a responsible person, I would say. 
I would also say that I'm kind of like... What can I say? I'm eager to develop."
In the new position? I've been working for about three months.
Yes. For information, I got a job through an outsourcing agent. So I applied the job through this third party.
my outsourcing agent informed me that there was a company that is interested in me. And then I said, yes, okay. And then I did the interview.
The process took also more or less one week or so
I came to the office pretty much to meet my new team leader. 
he only showed me around, like where is what and what is what.
If I have like the access for anything or everything that I need for the work, like all the softwares or programs that I need for the work.
it wasn't that much, but it was quite clear. I mean, it was only through email.
basically during this one week gap, like time gap, basically we didn't do much. I only got like two emails, no phone calls, only emails. Okay.
there's like my first impression when they were like invited me directly to the company, like in person to meet my team leader. So my first impression was like, yeah, OK, then they really want me
. So I got this impression that they appreciate me and they want me to be there, to be part of their team. That's actually my impression.
when I came there for the first time on my first day, you can say so, I didn't have any impression, to be honest. 
, it was a bit annoying, frankly speaking, because then I had to start over again, I had to learn new things from the beginning again and stuff, so my impression, it wasn't that good, but it wasn't that bad either, so it was quite middle, I'd say.
, it was quite demanding from the side of my team leader, because it was like too much information at once,
everything came at once and it was quite demanding in a way that, in a sense that quite stressful, in my opinion.
it was quite demanding in a sense of, you know, it's kind of stressful, I would say.
The thing that probably affected the trust quite badly for me, it was the amount of workload, actually.
Then my trust was a bit shaky, actually, a little bit. Because all of these many things, I understand why I had to stay longer. Because as I say, that's actually the result of so much information at once.
I mean, they're quite helpful. So their responses are actually pretty good.
If they have questions and stuff, they're willing to help me to solve the problems and stuff. And the team leader also. 
the colleagues and the team leader, they're actually quite helpful, I would say.
to recalculate the workload that an employee has.
sometimes it's quite too much and someone can get very overwhelmed. So probably a better calculation for the workload, actually
quality assurance software testing 
I studied business informatics back home in Albania. After that I worked for one year in the area of quality assurance software testing and then I moved to Austria to study a in project management. At the same time, after a while, after being incorporated and being part of the life here, I started looking for something else for a job and now I'm working again in the same area
for almost five to six months
I come from Albania.
I like to describe myself as a very inclusive person, so I really like to include other people in the team, also very communicative and pretty like a team player, wanting to always be part of not only decision making but also in other social areas of teamwork, not just actually work but also the social part of working.
. I was in communication with the company and people from human resources all the time. They would explain to me how things were and give me the necessary information of my position and also about the company.
before actually starting the on-boarding phase, they had set up an on-boarding buddy for me and he sent me an email with all the explanations about the job, about the project, about what I needed to enhance the skills before actually joining this project 
"I think it was very professional. We generally were in contact with emails during this stage, nothing else.

No teams or any other communication tool, but I think it's very professional and everything is documented, so they would just communicate with my personal email until I would get the email from the company."
Comparing to previous experiences, it was a higher frequency of communication
I had to wait for a while, so that made me a bit anxious, but when I received the email from my onboarding buddy and I started being in contact with him, the communication was, let's say, at least once per week and that was a pretty good experience comparing to experiences and frequency of communication with the company that I worked before.
I think at that time I did not have much any idea how things worked and I was a bit anxious how things worked there and what is expected of me
I could enter the social media or the website and check how is working life for this company, what activities they do, is there any growth opportunity, learning opportunities as well, and I had everything in this website and I could figure out a bit more what was going on and how the company culture is,
I would say they were pretty supportive for me and they would always respond any questions that I have and since I was also non-EU national
because I had to delay my onboarding for one month because of that, but I was pretty calm because they would always take over, send me an email of what's going on and apply again and inform me of everything, which made this non-pleasant experience better and I would be reassured that I would get the job and I would get onboarding on time.
, I was in frequent communication via email with the HR person, with the person that actually did the interviews with me and followed up on everything
he invited me to go to the office, to the premises and I could actually see and touch a little bit where the place was and what it looked like, to meet some people there and let them know that I would be the new employee
really helped because I felt the first day after I joined, I felt like I've been in this place before, I pretty much know how the office looks like, where is everything pretty much and this introduction was very needed and necessary and I think it was a very good example that this pre-onboarding was really good on their side.
was the incident with the legal issues and they would be all the time in communication with me to make me calm and reassured that everything is all right and we can handle this and we are taking over this process 
I felt a strong confidence that it's a company that keeps the word and they're doing what they're saying that they are going to do and that was a really good instance let's say to give me the confidence that yeah I'm joining a really good culture with responsible people and people who are willing to help.
just communicate a bit more 
Because sometimes during this trouble that I explained, the situation, I would need to write to them first what is going on and then they would instantly reply but I would really like for them to just tell me beforehand without needing to write them before 
it's important that in the end they would just reply to my emails to make me feel sure that things are going okay and we're going on the right direction together 
I remember it being very awkward because I'm also working in a industry that there are many men
everybody was super friendly
We had some technicalities with the tools that I needed to use 
they were super open to help me with anything and for any questions which really really helped
in itself the first day I remember it was a bit strange to me and I felt like what am I doing here? Do I really belong here?
they just called my name to introduce themselves that was a bit unprepared and a bit scared like I was not prepared of that 
thinking that yeah maybe also during onboarding there will happen something and I will not be supported enough but then it was much easier having an onboarding buddy 
also some other people from people and culture team approached me and they invited me to go for a short break together and to discuss all together
we would get to know also people from other teams living in other cities and in other countries 
it was a really nice event because we could network and meet people 
during the first three months of joining the organization despite onboarding being okay as a process in itself I was all the time questioning am I the right team
is a lot of things you need to learn 
I think also the cultural differences and the language barrier 
I think you could open up with it just with people in culture team and they were pretty understanding
I could socialize with other teams that were also more diverse and more people were more included 
there were people there and some of them were going through the same things and they had the same questions the same experiences and you could talk to them and let them know that yeah I'm going through this and that really really helped
event that was only for women joiners because then that's the moment when you feel really included in the organization that you feel heard
one-on-ones meetings with manager with project leaders where we could express different concerns and problems so that is how they tackled problems 
it's very important for them to have given me more of a background of what's going 
people themselves needed to be more inclusive 
to take the initiative to introduce themselves to me which rarely happened 
communication clear constant and honest communication 
is communication clear constant and honest communication 
discussing even the tough topics with honesty and

being able to talk about things that are not comfortable sometimes and also giving people reassurance that anything that you are going to say it's not going to impact your performance 
being able to talk about things that are not comfortable sometimes and also giving people reassurance that anything that you are going to say it's not going to impact your performance 
culture of giving feedback 
don't expect too much in the beginning 
nobody's expecting of you to perform in the first months 
I have a huge experience when it comes to a long time of working when it comes to consultancy and now for almost five to seven years in the startup scene, supporting startups with different needs and different workshops and investors potential and pitch training and so on.
I'm very flexible. I am a fast learner and I am pro-challengers
Now it's like the third week now
Well, to be honest, I feel very lucky because I've been dealing with people that they were very, very considerable. 
During these three months
we were every second week or every third week of the month we were in communication, either by email or by phone, checking on each other. Mainly, they were the ones that they were checking on me if everything is fine, if we have everything.
I felt taken care. I felt that they really want me. That's why they waited for so long.
It's amazing because with her, maybe energy and the voice, she was calming me down with everything, even the stress, most stressful time that I had it, when she was calling and saying like, look, we are here for you. We wait.
we are here for you. Don't stress yourself. And that was like something that it was wow.
You are not just one plus number there, but you are a person, you are a human and they really do take into consideration this.
they are very internationalized. And that's why I felt that I would be also very well welcomed the very first day that I go. That's why it happened also.
, this feeling welcomed, even though I was not part of the company. They called me like one month before. They called me to have a team meeting and have lunch with them just to get to know the team.
So this was another motivation that, OK, things are really going well and they are really thinking in a human way, not just an extra number of doing some work there. This is what for me is very important
And in this day, I was there for one day whole, completely one day. And they took me in all the meetings that they were present during that day. So I was in the loop of all what was happening with the old project that I am dealing.
you want to know more what the company can offer, but they most of the time, they don't show everything what they have, but you get it and you learn it as soon as you get inside.
I was super excited, to be honest, but thrilled and happy. But in the same time, I was super scared,
you get to know everything step by step
they don't rush, they make it easy and they make it accessible. And to be honest, I felt very, to the team, I felt very, very welcome.
". You have a buddy that really takes care of you at least on the first two weeks.

And I was happy"
I had two people, two buddies
One buddy that was like specifically meeting me or presenting me the people, key people whom I should know and with whom I will have to work
another buddy was there to cherish me and give me all insight of the company on the best way possible
, I expected to, because I'm used to stuff that you are just put it into the water and then cold water and you swim. This is how all other jobs they were. Here, it was a bit different because they gave me, so since only this week, I started to be really onto the work of the things that I have to.
Last two weeks, I was getting to know people, learning about all the rules and code of conduct for the company, doing some exams, trainings and stuff. So it was two weeks, like fully letting me on my own and getting to know some people
they gave me the time that I need and they let it be that two weeks I get to know things and I get to get my know-how.
Believe me, after the first week, I said to my family and friends and to myself first that, oh, I feel that now I found my place.
There is a family in between of them. So they really work close with each other. And I felt very welcomed into this family.
I think taking care, definitely
I think taking care, definitely. 
Communication is another one and letting to know the person, the employee, their rights and also their position in a way, how valuable they are in the company. This is what we really like and we feel amazing when we have it or when we hear it.

I felt it that I'm not just a number. I felt it like really they treat me like a human
Definitely be proactive by yourself also
Ask questions because they are always open to answer the questions and give you the right things and the right process and the right answers. This is very, very important.
If you are proactive, it gives also them the idea and the opinion that you are really interested in that. 
, I am 21 years old 
I am studying software engineering here in the city.
I am from Bulgaria
so I am a student abroad
I recently started my first job, actually, three months ago.
I'm working in their IT department
Yeah, I think what defines me is hard working.
, I really take a lot of care to do my assigned tasks 
am pretty reliable
pre-boarding for me was just two weeks
They sent me the contract and I had a period to review it and to ask questions.
So, I called the HR employee and I asked her the questions I had. She did tell me the answers and everything was fine with me, with her answers. And yeah, that was actually everything that happened
I asked my questions per email and I expected to get an email back with the answer
probably per email, if it was written, I could have a little bit more time to reflect on what she said to me and remember what exactly she said to me. 
So I had two days actually that I spent in the company and I saw how all the employees greet each other.
So everybody was very cheerful and nice and funny. So it wasn't a very like stiff environment. I don't know how to say it, but it was open, kind and friendly
And I felt like I would like to work in that company with such people. 
They could have given me a more clear description of what my tasks will be, because it was pretty vague. I didn't know what exactly I will be doing. Just an overview.
I was pretty nervous right before I came to the company
my team lead came and the HR too. So they greeted me and they were all friendly like an old friend that you haven't seen for a while.
I felt good that they reserved a place for me. And it was next to my mentor. I have a mentor as well in the onboarding phase.
So yeah, he was there the whole day and he showed me around, told me the most important stuff. I met a lot of new people there. So he was actually meeting me with everybody else.
Yeah, totally fine. They are all smiley.
It was a small talk, I guess, but I didn't feel nervous, I think. 
Yes, yes, I think so. Some days, for example, I didn't have anything to do and my mentor was having his own tasks, so I guess he couldn't give me something to do and I felt a bit bored and was like, okay, is this going to be my job? So, I have nothing to do, just mindlessly clicking around and not doing anything. 
I was a little pissed off because I'm there to get our experience and not there to just sit around and not do anything. And yeah, I felt concerned about my goals, I guess.
"We have weekly meetings with my team lead, so she always asks me how is it going, do you have any suggestions, is everything okay? Do you want to work on a particular topic?
Yeah, I think this is very helpful."
, I would suggest clarity in what exactly the employee will be doing. 
, I feel like sometimes HRs want to hide some things from the employee. And this just leaves gaps, so to say, in an employee's mind, and that does not contribute to trust.

I think that everything should be communicated clearly
I think that everything should be communicated clearly. 
Probably involving the employee in company activities.
don't be too stressed at the beginning, because as a new employee, we always try our hardest, I guess. But, it is enough what we do.
I'm 37 years old
I come from Austria.
I decided to switch careers 
"I must say I'm a very quiet and responsible person. I try to do my work with a lot of dedication. I want to always make sure that everything I do is perfectly done.

Other than that, people say that I'm very friendly and cooperative. My curious nature helps me learn new things very quickly. When I'm faced with something unfamiliar, I try to learn things logically and not by heart."
it was just a couple of days in between.
the HR manager with whom I was in contact since the day of my interview was very friendly. She let me know immediately the other steps of the employment procedure including the payment contract.
What I valued a lot from the company was their readiness to book a hotel room for my stay. Since I lived in Vienna and the company was located in Tyrol, we decided that I would work remotely after the probing month.
the HR was very communicative, answering all my questions pretty fast. Most of the communication was through mails and phone calls.
I felt very appreciated and valued because they put a lot of effort to make me feel good and to answer all my questions.
the company would offer me an apartment to stay and a car to use to go to work. These benefits made me feel valued and already part of the company, even though I had not yet started. They made me believe they wanted me as a long-time employee.

The HR manager was very kind to explain me all these benefits. Also, she was very fast to reply whenever I wrote her a message and asked questions.
I created the idea that the company was very kind to their employees, very professional and they valued employees' requests and opinions. This fact made me create trust on the company and decide to choose them as my future employer. I also had another opportunity with another company, but I decided to go with them due to reasons I already mentioned.
, I must admit, the company during the pre-boarding phase did a very good job to convince me to choose them.
I felt enthusiastic and very happy to start due to their dedication to me as an employee. As I understood, at that point they were a company with a flat hierarchy where the voice of the employees was heard and valued. The general feedback up to that point was very positive.

and I started working there after a couple of days. In my opinion, this was a very rushed decision because it didn't give me much time to prepare the moving to Tyrol and for other organizational issues. 
I felt happy to start not only because I was very enthusiastic for starting my new career but also because I felt I had made the right decision for choosing this company. I felt the company was like I wanted it to be, very helpful, employee-driven and with a lot of opportunities I could take advantage of.
they already went far more ahead than I thought they would to make me feel good and welcomed at the company. Communication was good and fast, benefits were also good, everything seemed to be right and I was happy.
As a result of their greater efforts, I created a lot of trust in the company during this phase. I was really looking forward to starting the job there.
The day before the first day at work was a bit stressful for me. I had a mix of feelings such as enthusiasm, fear, insecurity and tiredness due to the moving from Vienna to Tyrol. 
I got a welcome from the HR manager. She introduced me to all the departments and colleagues one by one. I was handed in my work equipment such as laptop, mouse, headset and all the username and passwords for my login accounts.
I felt very welcomed from the team leader too and from all my future colleagues as well. 
I was a bit scared because this new career was totally new for me and I didn't know how the work in a real company is and how would I manage to succeed.
taking a lot of information at once since the first day was very overwhelming. This made me feel even more insecure if I could do this job. They put me straight to the tasks without explaining first the processes, the company's products and services, the company's clients and so on.
I found myself the first day jumping in cold water, dealing and listening to other colleagues' meetings without understanding first what were they doing.
I was sitting there listening for 4 hours, taking notes, but no one had the time to explain if I had the question because they were in phone calls speaking with the customers. 
I would have to wait with my questions until someone was free to answer because they were busy most of the time on phone calls
, what I found very unexpected was the fast moving procedures and the company's rush to make me ready to start working independently as soon as possible. 
I was feeling insecure but I decided to give myself time.
Before the first day I felt insecure but happy to start and the beginning of the first day I felt welcomed and respected. This made the feeling of insecurity to fade a bit.
During the day I felt overwhelmed with all the information I received. I expected a more easy-paced environment the first day. This took me by surprise.
The colleagues made me feel good. They were all so friendly. 
The team leader didn't like my answer and started judging me and telling why don't you remember that. This is very basic, you should know this and so on. Actually this made me feel very bad and not supported at all.
priorities were not set clear at the beginning. And the proper training was missing.
Every time I had something or a problem they were there with a solution. The problems were mainly technical or organized.
The HR manager came every day to my desk asking if everything is going okay and if I needed something. The team leader as well. They tried to show me that they care and I found that particularly nice of them.
During onboarding I would very much like to have a buddy to explain me the tasks in detail to go through the processes with me. Every day I had another colleague taking care of me.
, if I had questions, I would very often have to wait until they were free to have an answer.
, the training part could definitely be better organized.
Secondly, the documentation of the processes was not clear at all. I didn't have a buddy, at least I should have had something to read and learn from it.
Furthermore, the feedback part is very important. I didn't receive that either. I wanted to know how I was going.
I was totally insecure about how things were going and I didn't receive it.
Unfortunately, I have to admit that I did the right choice to leave the company 
the training part for new employees could be better. 
The feedback is important 
the documentation of the processes as an instruction book would also be very helpful.
First, being honest with the employee and explaining everything clearly since the very beginning so that the employee knows what to expect.
Second, not trying to sell the company as the best company. And then step by step you realize that they are not what they looked like.
the company must be very professional with hiring. This would show employees that the company is serious and as a consequence also a company someone can trust.
check the company carefully before applying
Only in the details you can understand if the company is the one for you or not. If it is not okay since the beginning, then it won't be in the future
