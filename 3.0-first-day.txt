I would say that I was very confident since the first day I wasn't anxious, unlike my first, uh, experiences with other companies.
I was able to be in touch with the team, most specifically with the CEO and the CTO. 
I was introduced to the team, even though the company is a little bit small, the office and most of the employees are remote.
setting everything up in terms of hardware, software, uh, my work environment and everything. 
 the first experience was really good and positive, I would say, and quite professional. 
when I was introduced with all of this new stuff, I was overwhelmed and I felt a bit anxious and stressed, but then I was thinking, okay, this is what happens in every company and every onboarding. So everything requires some time.
I felt a lot of stress. Uh, not because of, in terms of expertise, but as I said, it's because it was something new and your company and your environment. So that plays a role.
Of course, you are scared because it's a different country, it's a different language and you are not sure what you'll find here. 
it was this feeling of having all foreigners around me, not just Austrians, there are from all over the world. And I have never had this kind of experience before.
Of course, I was scared. I was like, how is my colleague going to look like, going to feel like? How are they going to like receive me?
There were mixed emotions in this case. Maybe the frightening, like being afraid of moving into totally new place or country was sometimes overwhelming my warm feelings towards the new place, towards the new employer. It was like fluctuating.
. Initially, I anticipated a bit colder culture here from the other colleagues and the teams. 
, I was surprisingly, in a positive manner, surprised actually because they really welcomed me in a good way in this case.
. Just an ease onboarding started with some onboarding trainings.
There were quite a lot of people, a lot of trainees that were at the same moment when I joined. So, it was a strange environment, a strange feeling at the beginning because everyone was new and no one knew what and where he or she should go.
I would say it was a bit more difficult because when you are on the first day, you are learning, you are starting from scratch. 
. Because it's very stressful when you're international in a new country.
, that part is very stressful when you have to apply for a new visa and residence permit. That part is really nice by their side.
Of course, when you start a new job, of course, you're feeling a little bit anxious
They had organized everything. They put the things that I needed, like my laptop, the other parts, the screens and everything, the keyboard. They had prepared everything, my table.
They would give me a short introduction, again, about the company and hierarchy, organigram and stuff like that, more detailed. And then I would meet with IT. They would give me all my passwords, everything that I needed for my work.
Meeting the team was really nice because, as I said, I was introduced in my interviews, but I did not know them personally, so I was kind of networking between the departments a little bit. And that day, it went like that. Half of the day was trying to get to know everyone and trying to network with the colleagues.
And after that, I was in a very short introduction of my tasks and how everything was structured in the department I'm currently working in. And so, this is how the first day went by.
, it was a bit annoying, frankly speaking, because then I had to start over again, I had to learn new things from the beginning again and stuff, so my impression, it wasn't that good, but it wasn't that bad either, so it was quite middle, I'd say.
